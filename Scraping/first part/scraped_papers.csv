2Moscow State University",2,Abstract,"After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housi...",

2Moscow State University",2,Introduction,"After a 16-year hiatus, Russia resumed in 2013 its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19May 19, 2013), a specially designed automated spacecraft dedicated to life-science experiments. M in the mission's name stands for modernized; the epithet was equally applicable to the spacecraft and the research program. The principal animal species for physiological studies in this mission was the mouse ( Mus musculus ). Unlike more recent space experiments that used female mice, males were flown in the Bion-M 1 mission. The challenging task of supporting mice in space for this unmanned, automated, 30-day-long mission, was made even more so by the requirement to house the males in groups. Russian biomedical research in space traditionally has employed dogs, rats, monkeys, and more recently Mongolian gerbils. The flight of Laika in 1957 was one of the early dog experiments and became world famous for demonstrating that a li...",

2Moscow State University",3,Overview of the Bion-m 1 mission,"The scientific program of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed at obtaining data on mechanisms of adaptation of muscle, bone, cardiovascular, sensorimotor and nervous systems to prolonged exposure in microgravity and during post-flight recovery. To this aim, functional measurements in vivo were combined with complementary morphological, biochemical, cellular and molecular studies performed in vitro . To our knowledge, Bion-M 1 is the first study with mice to follow the dynamics of re-adaptation to normal gravity or to assess post-flight in vivo functions. The in vivo measurements in-flight included video recording of mice behavior and continuous recording of arterial pressure during all stages of the flight. After the flight, testing of animal behavior, memory and learning, vestibular function, physical activity, strength and fitness, as well as continuous registration of cardiovascular parameters were performed. The set of in vivo measurements was designed to provide data on the effects of ...",Introduction

Notably, water intake via the paste food diet was 4.250.67 g/10 g BW, or roughly three times ad libitum water consumption, when water was presented separately from dry, pelleted diet (p0.0001, Mann Whitney test). Apparently the need for nutrients, rather than thirst, governed the paste food consumption. While no adverse impact of this increased water intake was evident, mice maintained on paste diet produced more urine that was more dilute than normal. When paste food was introduced, water consumption decreased roughly 5 times its original amount; body weight inc...",Results and Discussion

The health status and functional state of the implanted mice were carefully monitored after surgery because the novelty of this procedure as part of a long spaceflight constituted a major risk factor for the mission. Thirty-five (35) mice were implanted with PA-C10 blood pressure transmitters. The mice tolerated with apparent ease telemetry probe implantation. As can be seen from body weight data, the acute recovery was complete by day 5 post-surgery ( Figure 4 ). At approximately the same time, mice were behaviorally recovered in terms of locomotor activity and nest building, and were reunited with their co-habitants.

Here, it is important to mention that probabilities of fulfilling each of the criteria are below 1. The probabilities of mice displaying a good BP signal, running vigorously in the wheel, performing well in discriminative learning, and maintaining amicable interactions with cagemates should be treated as independent and therefore should be multiplied to get the joint probability.

It should be noted that loss of all mice (n  15) in one assembly during space flight was a result of a gross malfunction of the food distribution system. Taking into account that the flight was aimed at exposing mice in the microgravity at, rather than evaluating the long established habitat system, survivorship would be calculated as 16 out of 30 mice (53). Loss of mice in the SF group was obviously higher than in GC (p0.0001, Fisher's exact test); however, the results of the control experiment are in concordance with data obtained during preliminary evaluation of the system, where none of the 15 mice died during a 30-day housing in the habitats (p  0.1760, Fisher's exact test).

It should be noted that never before have such extensive video records been collected and that this design feature alone could earn the modernization tag in the Bion-M1 designation. The library of video recordings from the two habitat assemblies consisted of 2,476, 30-min segments of individual habitats, captured during both light and dark phases of each day of the mission, as described earlier. As might be expected, video quality was superior in the early phases of the flight and visibility was compromised over time, as floating liquids and debris tended to obscure the camera lens and the general atmosphere of the habitats.

2Moscow State University",3,Post-flight adjustment of experimental groups,"Due to the partial loss of mice during the flight, the number of animals in other groups had to be adjusted ( Table 6 ). The number of control mice (GC, SFV, GCV) for in vitro studies was decreased proportionately to the number of SF animals available. This decision was made basing on the relatively small variability of the measures to be taken in inbred C57 mice [12] and time considerations (complete dissection of one animal lasted 1.01.2 hours and dissection of all the mice took more than 24 hours). Taking that accidental death of mice in flight was a random event and that bodyweight data from all the animals was available, the mice for control groups were selected to match the initial bodyweight of SF mice. Different tactics were chosen for the in vivo subgroups. The behavioral data were characterized by high variability, at the same time all the animals designated for in vivo studies underwent preliminary testing and selection, taking this into account the number of mice for in viv...",General Outcomes

2Moscow State University",2,Conclusions,"The Bion-M 1 flight was unique in many ways, particularly the unprecedented duration of an automated mission with living animals. The sex of the mice was male, thus imposing greater attention to creation and selection of stable groups of mice for social housing. The overall success was evident: aggressive interactions were noted on single occasions and under conditions of starvation only. The use of male animals is obviously required for research in male reproduction and their larger size compared to females offered clear advantages. Our program of mice training for flight and control experiments of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed to: ensure that mice adapt to stressful conditions of space flight when housed in groups; to collect baseline data from these mice; select homogenous groups; and, more generally, to promote collection of less variable data. The results of our program presented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not be excluded a priori , but quite on the contrar...",

1Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",2,Abstract,"Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n  8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29, and bone thickness of 11.91. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170 (p  0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT...",

1Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",2,Introduction,"On Earth, at 1 g, mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. Forces generated by gravity such as hydrostatic pressure, stretch, and fluid shear are well known to promote normal tissue growth and repair mechanisms. Conversely, during spaceflight, gravity-generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. Direct and immediate physiological responses to microgravity-induced mechanical unloading include adaptive losses of bone [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] and muscle mass [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , and alterations in cardiovascular function [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] . Because of practical reasons, most space biological animal research has focused on the short-term effects of spaceflight, and thus our understanding of long-term effects of microgravity exposure is very limited. However, it is likely that over long periods of time mechanical unloading in micro...",

1Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",3,Spaceflight Causes Osteoclast and Osteocyte-Mediated Bone Loss in the Pelvic Region of Mice,"To determine if bone loss occurred in microgravity, we examined the bone structure and mineral density of the ischial region of the pelvis using micro-computed tomography (µCT). Specifically, we investigated the region from the caudal apex of the obturator foramen through to the ischial tuberosity ( Fig. 1A ) and found that spaceflight resulted in a 6.23 decrease (p  0.005) in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and 11.91 decrease (p  0.002) in overall bone thickness (Th) ( Table 1 ). No difference was observed in bone mineral density and total bone volumes measured (TV and BV) ( Table 1 ). However, comparison of ischial structural thickness of spaceflight versus ground control animals revealed that bone from flight animals not only had a reduced overall thickness ( Fig. 1F and G ), but also showed changes in ischial shape localized to the surface of the descending ramus of ischium along the posterior margin of the obturator foramen ( Fig. 1B ).

The anatomical markers used for μCT analysis were (1) caudal apex of obturator foramen, (2) dorsal-most point of the ventral ramus of ischium, and (3) the ischial tuberosity ( A ) (For full details on anatomical markers see [74] ). The ischial cross-sectional geometry ( B ) was analyzed by length (a), the width at the midpoint (b) and at 1/3 distance from the obturator foramen (c); and the bend angle (d). Flight samples ( D ) exhibited a more open cross-sectional geometry compared to the ground control ( C ), indicating a possible reduction in the pull force applied to the bone.

Several molecules associated with Ras signaling displayed alterations, including Nf1 (1.45 fold, p0.05) and Sos1 (2.51 fold, p0.01); however, only small changes in KRas expression was found (1.24 fold, p0.05) ( Fig. 5B , Table 3 ). No statistically significant alterations in Pi3K subunits were noted except a small change in the alpha polypeptide of the cat...",Results

1Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",2,Discussion,"In this study, we investigated cellular and molecular gene expression mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space, with an emphasis on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities in the pelvic girdle and proximal femur of 16-week-old C57BL/6J female mice. Although data in this field is not extensive, exposure to microgravity is known to alter bone homeostasis, causing primarily increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and possibly inhibition of bone formation. Here we sought to test the hypothesis that like osteoclastic activity, osteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis, may also contribute to bone loss in space. We first characterized standard bone mineral and structural parameters following spaceflight to establish the magnitude of bone loss in our microgravity model system. Our results confirm the ischium portion of the pelvis ( Fig. 1A ) lost 6.3 (p  0.005) bone volume fraction and 11.9 (p  0.002) in bone thickness ( Table 1 ) ...",

1Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",3,Conclusions,"In total, our findings demonstrate the pelvic-femoral musculo-skeletal complex as a highly load and gravity sensitive structure that can serve as a valuable model to study muscle and bone degeneration in space. Additionally, we demonstrate that bone responses to spaceflight are complex and involve osteoclastic, osteoblastic, and osteocytic degenerative responses. Finally, our findings on CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity have the potential to become a major concern for tissue regenerative health in long-duration spaceflight. Future studies should address the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms of CDKN1a/p21 involvement in tissue degeneration during long-term spaceflight and the possibility of systemic activation of this strong molecular inhibitor of regenerative adult stem cell proliferation.",Discussion

A global binarization threshold of 65/255 was applied to the reconstructed images. As the mouse ischium is a thin bone with similarly sized bridge-like trabeculae connecting two opposing cortical sheets, we were unable to analyse cortical and trabecular bone regions separately. Instead we contoured along a perimeter of the cortical bone using a shrink-wrap custom plug-in of CTan software and analyzed them together. The following indices for mineralized tissue were investigated: total volume of region of interest (TV), bone volume of region of interest (BV), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), average thickness (Th), and mean linear attenuation coefficient. In addition to calculated indices, 3D analysis included the generation of color-coded image maps of ischial structure ...",Micro-Computed Tomography (µCT)

1Grupo de Investigación en Salud (GIS), Departamento de Medicina Interna, Universidad del Cauca",2,Abstract,"Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bo...",

1Grupo de Investigación en Salud (GIS), Departamento de Medicina Interna, Universidad del Cauca",2,1. Introduction,"Microgravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravitational forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate this state [ 1 , 2 ]. In cellular biology, microgravity presents a unique opportunity to study how cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravitya fundamental factor that regulates numerous cellular processes on Earth [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical forces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn affect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication, and survival [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. Historically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such as the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial laboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rota...",

Impact on T Cells,"Microgravity profoundly affects T cell-mediated immunity, disrupting activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin Aa standard activator of resting T cellsrevealed significant inhibition of activation and proliferation in CD4 and CD8 T cells, with the effects intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of activation markers such as CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71 (iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction [ 11 , 12 ]. CD4 T cells, critical for regulating immune responses through cytokines like IL-2 and IFN-γ, show a greater reduction in proliferation and cytokine production compared to CD8 T cells. Even brief exposure (8 h) to microgravity notably suppresses CD4 cell functions, while CD8 cells require longer exposure (16 h) to exhibit similar impairments [ 11 , 12 ]. Cytokine production is notably compromised under microgravity. CD4 cells exhibit decreased secretion of IL-2, essential for T cell expansi...",3. Effects of Microgravity on the Immune System

The RAS pathway, which governs cell proliferation and survival, shows reduced activity under microgravity, leading to impaired cell growth. Similarly, ERK, which is essential for cell differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes alterations that hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes. NF-κB, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent activation in microgravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses [ 1 , 4 ]. Research on microgravity has also revealed significant effects on cancer biology, including the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and the regulation of key proteins such as p53 (a tumor suppressor), NF-κB (a regulator of immune responses and inflammation), and BAX (a pro-apoptotic protein involved in programmed cell death).

For nearly two decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells under microgravity have yielded valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to achieve under conventional laboratory conditions. In microgravity, adherent thyroid cancer cells lose their adhesion properties and organize into multicellular spheroids. These structures closely resemble the physiological characteristics of tumors in vivo, making them ideal models for studying metastasis and evaluating novel targeted therapies [ 30 , 31 ].

Experimental models using rhesus macaques have shown that prolonged exposure to microgravity induces significant metabolic alterations similar to those observed in rodents. These include lipid accumulation and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, reflecting the disruption of hepatic metabolic homeostasis. Such findings underscore the importance of exploring the effects of microgravity on metabolic regulation in animal models and future human studies [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] ( Figure 3 ). In a 42-day head-down bed rest model simulating microgravity, rhesus macaques developed mild liver lesions, fat vacuole accumulation, and inflammatory cell infiltration.

In this context, innovative experimental approaches have been developed, including the use of microfluidic microchips and collagen-encapsulated cell spheroids. These advanced models enable researchers to investigate how the absence of mechanical loading affects bone cell maturation and mineralization.

However, the specific effects of microgravity on these interactions and the overall evolution of follicles have only recently begun to be understood [ 47 ]. In an experiment replicating microgravity conditions, ovarian follicles were cultured in a simulated system. The results indicated that while follicle growth and survival rates were not significantly affected and remained comparable to those observed under normal gravity conditions, the quality of the eggs released was markedly reduced [ 47 , 48 , 49 ].

Mitochondrial biogenesis enables cells to produce energy more efficiently, a key factor for the proper functioning of mature cardiomyocytes. Experimental data have demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial content, evidenced by the expression of specific mitochondrial proteins and an elevated ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA.

Hematopoietic Differentiation,"Simulated microgravity significantly enhances the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into hematopoietic lineages, offering a promising avenue for regenerative medicine and cell therapies [ 55 , 56 , 57 ]. Under microgravity conditions, hematopoietic stem cells demonstrate more efficient induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading to improved formation of functional three-dimensional structures. This results in a notable increase in active hematopoietic cells, optimizing both cell expansion and differentiation processes [ 55 , 56 , 57 ]. Transcriptomic analyses have identified the differential activation of thousands of genes involved in hematopoiesis, including RUNX1, SOX17, and GATA1.

Conclusions,"Microgravity presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology, profoundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This environment, distinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological functions such as immune activity, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing homeostasis critical for human health. Emerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity, including its impact on the immune system, where T cell function diminishes, increasing susceptibility to infections. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit altered behavior under microgravity, providing new insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic approaches. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into how microgravity influences disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Microgravity also affects the physiology of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and bones, with implications for und...",

1Department of Plastic Surgery, Jichi Medical University 3311-1, Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-Shi",2,Abstract,"Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3() hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG,...",

1Department of Plastic Surgery, Jichi Medical University 3311-1, Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-Shi",2,1. Introduction,"Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells from adipose tissue. They have increasingly been used to ameliorate a broad range of refractory diseases, including irradiated tissue [ 1 ], ischemic wounds [ 2 ], and diabetic ulcers [ 3 ]. However, their clinical efficacy has been limited because the long-term survival of transplanted hASCs is diminished by environmental stress [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. Consequently, hASC therapeutic mechanisms have been limited to the secretion of cytokines and growth factors to promote cell recruitment, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]. In contrast, embryonic stem cells retain their potency and are thought to be superior to adult stem cells for regenerative potential [ 11 ]. However, the use of embryonic stem cells is limited by ethical issues [ 12 ]. Modern research has made gains toward a better understanding of stem-cell heterogeneity [ 13 , 14 ]. Within stem-cell pools ...",

Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive Cells in the hASC Pool,"First, SSEA-3 marker expression was assessed in normal hASCs using flow cytometry. Adherent P3 hASCs from each donor were detached using TrypLE Express, centrifuged, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were sieved through 100 and 40 μm mesh filters, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended for analysis. The isolated cells were incubated with rat anti-SSEA-3 antibody (1:50; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and detected using an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgM (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using a multicolor flow cytometer (MACS-Quant). Control gates were set based on staining with a labeled non-specific antibody (matched isotype control immunoglobulin G (IgG)); no more than 0.1 of the cells were deemed positive using the non-specific antibody. To assess the stress durability of SSEA-3-positive cells, adherent P3 hASCs were exposed to a variety of optimized stress conditions (heat, 45 C for 1 min; low-pH solu...",2. Materials and Methods

Preparation of Microspheres,"Two kinds of microspheres were used as cell carriers during cell culture. First, crosslinked polystyrene microspheres (Polystyrene Beads Large, Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) with diameters between 200300 μm were used. For good cell attachment, the polystyrene surfaces were hydrophilized using a 30 min plasma treatment from a vacuum plasma apparatus (YHS-DφS, Sakigake-Semiconductor, Kyoto, Japan). Ten grams of polystyrene microspheres (approximately 2.4 million microbeads with a total surface area of 4000 cm 2 ) were washed three times in 70 ethanol for sterilization and diluted in 15 mL of PBS. Secondly, collagen microspheres (100200 μm diameters, Cellagen; Koken, Tokyo, Japan) manufactured from reconstituted collagen obtained from bovine skin and crosslinked with 0.5 hexamethylene diisocyanate were used. Pre-sterilized vials (15 mL) contained approximately three million collagen beads with a total surface area of approximately 4000 cm 2 .",2. Materials and Methods

Polystyrene and collagen microsphere solutions (0.3 mL), representing a total surface area of approximately 80 cm 2 , were added to 3.5 cm diameter, non-adherent, polystyrene dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). The dishes were placed onto a continuous-action shaker (Wave-PR, Taitec, Saitama, Japan), capable of shaking the microspheres in three dimensions by combining movements from two axes (rotary and seesaw). As a result, the cumulative gravity vector toward the microspheres was minimized towards zero (i.e., microgravity). The unit was driven by a computer system which allowed for the adjustment of rotation speed and shaking angle (see Video S1 ). For each dish on the shaker, 1  10 5 P3 hASCs were suspended in 300 μL of DMEM/F12 and incubated at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5 carbon dioxide in humid air.

For each tube, the supernatant was removed, and the complexes were washed using PBS. Cells were enzymatically released by incubation with 5 mL of TrypLE Express for 15 min at 37 C. Cell suspensions were diluted with additional culture medium (5 mL) and sieved through 100 and 40 μm mesh collector screens.

Cell Growth in Microsphere Cultures,"Numerical measurement of viable cells cultured on polystyrene and collagen microspheres, or in polystyrene and collagen dishes was carried out using a dual-fluorescence automated cell counter (Luna-FL). P3 hASCs (1  10 5 ) were seeded onto polystyrene and collagen microspheres under dynamic conditions, or onto polystyrene and collagen dishes as static monolayer cultures. The cells were retrieved by trypsinization and counted on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14, and growth rates were calculated (i.e., hASC growth rate  hASC number on day 7/day 1). Data were gathered from six separate samples. Visualizations of hASCs cultured on polystyrene and collagen microspheres were carried out on day 7 using a light microscope (Leica DM-LB, Wetzlar, Germany) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-3500N, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at a beam energy of 25 kV. For the observing the collagen microspheres, a cryo-SEM technique at 130 C was used so as not to scatter and lose uncharged microspheres.",2. Materials and Methods

1Department of Plastic Surgery, Jichi Medical University 3311-1, Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-Shi",2,4. Discussions,"Through novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have been shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer potentially greater translational benefits. SSEA-3() Muse cells, a representative type of highly functional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared to regular stem cells [ 32 ]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow hASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with higher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3() hASCs to only approximately 1 [ 19 ]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental stress greatly influences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency of stem cells [ 33 , 34 ]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant influence on cultured cells. Numerous studies ...",

Conclusions,"We cultured hASCs with microspheres using three-dimensional movement to create microgravity conditions for the preservation of stemness, while at the same time preserving cellmicrosphere adhesion to maximize cell quantities. This new cell-culturing technique selectively enhanced the proliferation of highly functional stem cells, demonstrating superior stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenic abilities, which may provide for enhanced treatments for intractable human diseases compared to current hASC treatments. However, further studies are required to optimize a culture protocol to maximize the selective expansion efficiency and to investigate the therapeutic value of these cells using in vivo experiments before clinical trials can proceed.",

1Space Biosciences Research Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",2,Abstract,"The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performe...",

1Space Biosciences Research Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",2,Introduction,"The ISS National Laboratory is a unique research environment whereby scientists from Academia, Government, and Industry seek to learn the effects of space on life and matter in their many forms. Although a great deal has already been learned about the effects of microgravity on biological systems, [ 1  3 ] the large majority of on-orbit experiments do not yield scientific data until long after return of samples to Earth for analysis, creating concerns about timeliness of data availability, and quality of sample preservation [ 4 ]. Ground analysis of on-orbit experiments has been necessary because of limited laboratory space, equipment, supplies, and astronaut time resources on ISS, but while this sample return approach maximizes efficient access to space by scientists, it fails to teach us how to conduct end-to-end scientific inquiries in microgravity. As human exploration of the solar system proceeds, human missions to Mars and deep space will require greater levels of autonomy and re...",

1Space Biosciences Research Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",3,Fig 1. Operations for the WetLab-2 system.,"Open in a new tab Isolation and purification of RNA from biological tissues onorbit starts with introduction of cells or tissues for lysis and homogenization into the Sample Preparation Module (SPM), followed by RNA binding to an affinity column, washing, and elution from the module. A Pipette Loader (PL) tool is provided for bubble free fluid transfer to a repeater pipette. This is then used to dispense accurate volumes of purified RNA into a centrifuge rotor/rack of lyophilized reagent tubes with enzymes and regents for reverse transcription and Taqman RT-qPCR. Data is available on-orbit within 3h of initiating the experiment, and transmitted by ISS to NASA Marshall Space Flight Center for emailing to investigators within 2 h of clean-up. A more detailed description of the process can be found in the S1 Text .",Introduction

1Space Biosciences Research Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",2,Materials and methods,"In order to validate the system, a number of ground-based and on-orbit tests were performed including: validation of E . coli primer assays (ground), validation of lyophilized components (ground), validation of the SPM (ground), validation of all hardware (ground), validation of qPCR efficiency using pre-prepared assays (on-orbit), validation of RNA extracted from E . coli (on-orbit), and from mouse liver tissue (on-orbit) using the SPM. The methods used in these validation experiments are described in detail below. Primer and probe design This study used three types of assays for different portions of the validation of the system. First, an E . coli genomic assay was used to demonstrate if qPCR was possible in microgravity and that the data matched 1 g controls. This was followed with a set of E . coli gene expression assays designed to validate the sample prep and RT-qPCR capabilities of the system.

Finally, a set of mouse gene expression assays were used to validate the system with a mammalian tissue. The E . coli primers and probes used in this study were designed in-house to target both genomic and exonic regions. The E . coli genomic assay consisted of primers targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence for rrnH gene while the gene expression assays targeted the following genes: heat shock protein 702 ( dnaK ), RNA polymerase ( rpoA ), and a glucitol operon repressor ( srlR ).

Data from the first run is shown in Fig 2B and has a typical qPCR amplification curve, although an unusual amount of noise was observed in microgravity samples especially in later cycles. Furthermore, when the default SmartCycler software values were used, outliers were observed resulting in high standard deviations between replicate samples. These outliers did not impair the clustering of the on-orbit data with the respective DNA concentrations. Data from a second run was similar to the first but a third repeat run did not yield results due to tube dispensing errors attributed to a PL malfunction.

Care was taken to match the removal time of the lyophilized assays from 4C to the start of operations. Fig 2C2F shows side-by-side comparisons of microgravity runs and their matched 1 g controls. Amplification curves from the corresponding 1 g control runs were smooth and similar to those obtained during previous testing. Non-specific amplification, as observed from the NTC tubes (black lines), were seen on both microgravity and 1 g control graphs. Given that the target gene is a 16S rRNA, non-specific amplification in the NTC samples may be seen when Taq polymerase is bacteria-derived [ 27 ] or due to primer derived artifacts. Microgravity fluorescence intensity values also show a lower overall amplitude potentially due to bubbles blocking/reducing some of the collected fluorescence signal [ 24  26 ].

To test this, half of the modified reaction tube septa caps were replaced with standard SmartTube caps. However, the age of the sample preparation reagents was past the latest longevity testing duration and this test resulted in compromised Ct values in the FAM and Cy5 channels. The HEX channel appeared to be unaffected as seen in Fig 4 . A reduction in noise was observed with the use of standard caps ( Fig 4B ) as compared to the typical noise seen when septa caps are used ( Fig 4A ). Additionally, photos taken of the tubes after completion of the RT-qPCR run show an increase in the number of bubbles in the septa capped tubes as compared to those with standard caps.

1Space Biosciences Research Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California",2,Discussion,"One of the major obstacles to space exploration going forward in the coming decades is the fact that microgravity research outposts such as ISS are so closely dependent on Earth support of everyday activities, and lack the ability to operate autonomously. The National Academies of Sciences in their Decadal Survey [ 5 ] have identified some of these limitations as important concerns and offered direction that the ISS should operate more like Earth-based laboratories, allowing for experiments to be designed, conducted, modified and iterated in space. Despite the thousands of investigations already conducted on ISS [ 31 ], there are still overwhelming limitations [ 32 , 33 ] that prevent science and specifically molecular biology measurements of gene expression from being conducted and analyzed on-orbit. From its inception, the NASA WetLab-2 project has sought to address these concerns by introducing new, time-efficient, practical and flexible molecular biology gene expression analysis ca...",
